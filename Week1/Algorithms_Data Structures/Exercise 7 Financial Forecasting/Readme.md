Purpose:
Calculates the future value of an investment using both recursive and iterative approaches to demonstrate financial forecasting.
Used In:
FinancialProjection.java
echnical Highlights:

    Recursive Calculation: Computes compound interest by reducing the problem year-by-year using a base case.

    Iterative Calculation: Uses a loop to compound the investment value annually.

    Currency Formatting: Uses NumberFormat with locale support to format output as INR (â‚¹).

    User Input: Accepts present value, interest rate, and number of years from the user.
 Benefits:

    Helps compare performance and design of recursive vs iterative implementations.

    Introduces basic concepts of compound interest and investment growth modeling.

    Useful in building financial calculators and simulation tools.

    Provides real-world application of mathematical modeling in Java.
